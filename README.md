# simple-neural-network
A general intelligence.
Generally pretty intelligent at estimating curves.

This Library can create and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural-Network with:

-- Only ReLU nodes
-- Standard Backpropogation training
-- Feedforward structure (no recurrence)

The code has an example of use.
