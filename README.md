# simple-neural-network
Generally pretty intelligent at estimating curves.

This Library can create and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural-Network with:

-- Only ReLU nodes
-- Standard Backpropogation training
-- Feedforward structure (no recurrence)
-- No bias, a bias can be added by adding a dimension to the input whos value is always 1

The code has an example of use.
